To update your project's documentation to reflect Angular 9, here's a rewritten version:

---

# Carbonator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. Starting with Angular 9, it's important to use the new `--configuration production` flag for optimized production builds.

For production build:
```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This will use the `karma.conf.js` configuration to run the tests in your browser.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). This command will use your `e2e` configuration to run the tests.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI, use `ng help` or check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## How It Works

Carbonator uses a simplified set of equations to model the climate system's evolution over time. By reducing the complexity of full-scale climate models, it provides valuable insights into key global trends without the heavy computational overhead.
